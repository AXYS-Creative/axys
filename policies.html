            Non-compliance will result in immediate prohibition from using the

            will nullify the ongoing relationship between AXYS Creative and the

          <p>
            The Website, owned by AXYS Creative, encompasses a wide array of
            materials, including but not limited to source code, databases,
            software, designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics
            (collectively referred to as the "Content"), as well as trademarks,
            service marks, and logos (the "Marks"). These elements are the
            exclusive property of AXYS Creative, protected under U.S. copyright,
            trademark laws, relevant foreign jurisdictions, and international
            conventions. The Content and Marks are provided "as-is" for your
            informational and personal use.
            <br />
            <br />
            For clients using CMS websites, the content you upload and manage
            within the CMS is considered your property. However, any templates,
            themes, or proprietary code provided by AXYS Creative as part of the
            CMS service remain the exclusive property of AXYS Creative. Except
            as explicitly stated in this Agreement, no part of the Website, CMS,
            or its Content may be duplicated, replicated, compiled, published,
            uploaded, displayed, translated, transmitted, disseminated, sold,
            licensed, or utilized for any commercial purpose without the
            express, prior written consent of AXYS Creative. All rights not
            expressly granted are reserved by AXYS Creative concerning the
            Website, CMS, its Content, and the Marks.

          <p>
            Despite AXYS Creative's ownership of Submissions as outlined in
            Paragraph 6 ("Client Feedback"), all original design and development
            source files crafted for the Client ("Projects") are the exclusive
            property of the Client. The Client holds full copyright ownership of
            all Projects. In any circumstance where AXYS Creative might
            inadvertently become the owner or part-owner of a Project due to
            legal reasons, AXYS Creative will unconditionally and permanently
            transfer all its rights in the Project to the Client. The Client
            guarantees that all materials supplied to AXYS Creative, whether as
            inspiration or as components of a project during the design process,
            are owned by the Client and do not violate or misappropriate any
            third-party rights. This includes, but is not limited to,
            intellectual property rights and rights of publicity. AXYS Creative
            retains the right to publicly display the Client's design and
            development work (on social media, its website, etc.) unless
            otherwise specified and agreed upon as detailed in Paragraph 18
            ("Sharing and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Provision") of this
            Agreement.

          <h2 class="policies-title">3. Fonts and Typeface</h2>
          <p>
            Should any Project include fonts not owned by AXYS Creative that
            necessitate a commercial license for the Client's legal
            reproduction, distribution, or public display ("Third-Party Fonts"),
            AXYS Creative will duly notify the Client in writing. This
            notification will confirm the inclusion of Third-Party Fonts in the
            Project and advise the Client of the need to acquire the appropriate
            licenses from the respective rights holders. The notice will provide
            sufficient details to enable the Client to identify the required
            licenses and contact information for purchasing them. Once AXYS
            Creative has informed the Client about the use of Third-Party Fonts
            as outlined above, it is then the Client's responsibility to procure
            these licenses. The Client will bear all responsibility for any
            legal implications or consequences stemming from not obtaining the
            necessary licenses for any Third-Party Fonts used in the Project.

            The Client is authorized to access and use the Website solely for
            its intended purposes. The Website is not to be employed for any

            The Client acknowledges and agrees that any submissions they make,
            including questions, comments, suggestions, or other types of
            feedback ("Submission"), will become the exclusive property of AXYS
            Creative. AXYS Creative is not obligated to maintain the

            permission, acknowledgment, or providing compensation to the Client.
            The Client confirms that they have the authority to make the

          <h2 class="policies-title">7. Management and Supervision</h2>
          <p>
            AXYS Creative reserves the right to oversee and manage the Website,
            including any CMS platforms provided as part of our services, to
            ensure compliance with these Terms of Use. This includes the
            authority to take appropriate legal actions against any breaches of
            these Terms or violations of applicable laws, statutes, or
            regulations. AXYS Creative also retains the discretion to limit or
            deny access to the Website or disable the Client's use of it,
            including any CMS functionalities.
            <br />
            <br />
            In cases where a Client pauses or cancels their primary membership,
            the CMS feature ('Admin Permissions') can be kept active for a fee
            of $120/month. This fee ensures continued access to content
            management through the CMS, allowing the Client to maintain and
            manage their content independently. Similar to the primary
            memberships, this feature can be paused or canceled anytime. Failure
            to pay this fee will result in the suspension of CMS access.
            <br />
            <br />
            All decisions regarding the management and supervision of the
            Website and CMS platforms are at the exclusive discretion of AXYS

            AXYS Creative holds the right to determine refund eligibility at its
            own discretion, without the obligation to notify or bear liability
            towards the Client. Each refund request is evaluated on a
            case-by-case basis, with no guarantee of approval. It is important
            to note that AXYS Creative does not typically offer refunds, and any
            exceptions are made strictly under specific circumstances. In the
            rare event that a refund is granted within the first month of use,
            all materials produced by AXYS Creative during this period remain
            the exclusive property of AXYS Creative. The Client is strictly
            prohibited from using these materials in any capacity. If a refund
            is approved, a fee amounting to 20% of the outstanding billable
            period will be applied. Furthermore, AXYS Creative reserves the
            right to pursue legal measures against the Client for any violation
            of this policy.

          <p>
            The AXYS Creative Referral Program offers a commission-based reward
            for each successful business referral made to us. To qualify for the
            10% recurring monthly commission, the referred client must
            successfully subscribe to one of our services. There is no limit to
            the number of referrals an individual can make. Referrers earn a 10%
            recurring monthly commission based on the subscription price of the
            referred client’s membership. The commission will be paid monthly as
            long as the referred client remains subscribed to AXYS Creative
            services. If the referred client pauses or cancels their membership,
            all related commission payouts will cease immediately.

            <br aria-hidden="true" />
            <br aria-hidden="true" />

            Referral tracking and payouts are managed through our third-party
            partner,

            >
              Rewardful </a
            >. It is the referrer’s responsibility to ensure that their referral
            is properly tracked and reported through Rewardful to qualify for
            commissions. AXYS Creative is not liable for any delays or errors in
            tracking or payouts caused by Rewardful. AXYS Creative reserves the
            right to modify or terminate the referral program at any time
            without prior notice. Any commissions earned before such changes
            will still be honored under the terms in place at the time of the
            referral.
