        <h3 class="policies-title">1. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
        <p>
          The Website, owned by AXYS Creative, hosts a diverse range of
          materials including, but not limited to, source code, databases,
          software, designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics
          (collectively referred to as the "Content"), as well as trademarks,
          service marks, and logos (the "Marks"). These elements are the
          exclusive property of AXYS Creative, safeguarded under U.S. copyright,
          trademark laws, relevant foreign jurisdictions, and international
          conventions. The Content and Marks are presented "As-Is" solely for
          your informational and personal use. It is important to note that,
          except as explicitly stated in this Agreement, no part of the Website
          or its Content may be duplicated, replicated, compiled, published,
          uploaded, displayed, translated, transmitted, disseminated, sold,
          licensed, or utilized for any commercial purpose without the express,
          prior written consent of AXYS Creative. All rights not expressly
          granted are reserved by AXYS Creative in relation to the Website, its
          Content, and the Marks.

      <div class="policies policies-2">
        <h3 class="policies-title">2. Content Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          Despite AXYS Creative's ownership of Submissions as outlined in
          Paragraph 6 ("Client Feedback"), all original design and development
          source files crafted for Client ("Projects") are the exclusive
          property of the Client. The Client holds full copyright ownership of
          all Projects. In any circumstance where AXYS Creative might
          inadvertently become the owner or part-owner of a Project due to legal
          reasons, AXYS Creative will unconditionally and permanently transfer
          all its rights in the Project to the Client. Furthermore, the Client
          guarantees that all materials supplied to AXYS Creative, whether as
          inspiration or as components of a project during the design process,
          are owned by the Client and do not violate or misappropriate any
          third-party rights. This includes, but is not limited to, intellectual
          property rights and rights of publicity. It should also be noted that
          AXYS Creative retains the right to publicly display the Client's
          design and development work (on social media, its website, etc.)
          unless otherwise specified and agreed upon as detailed in Paragraph 18
          ("Sharing and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Provision") of this
          Agreement.

      <div class="policies policies-3">
        <h3 class="policies-title">3. Fonts and Typeface</h3>
        <p>
          Should any Project include fonts not owned by AXYS Creative that
          necessitate a commercial license for the Client's legal reproduction,
          distribution, or public display ("Third-Party Fonts"), AXYS Creative
          will duly notify the Client in writing. This notification will confirm
          the inclusion of Third-Party Fonts in the Project and advise the
          Client of the need to acquire the appropriate licenses from the
          respective rights holders. The notice will provide sufficient details
          to enable the Client to identify the required licenses and contact
          information for purchasing them. Once AXYS Creative has informed the
          Client about the use of Third-Party Fonts as outlined above, it is
          then the Client's responsibility to procure these licenses. The Client
          will bear all responsibility for any legal implications or
          consequences stemming from not obtaining the necessary licenses for
          any Third-Party Fonts used in the Project.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The Client consents to receiving electronic communications from AXYS
          Creative and agrees that all forms of agreements, notices,
          disclosures, and other communications provided via email or through
          the Website fulfill any legal obligation for such communications to be
          in writing. The Client also agrees to the use of electronic

          delivery of notices, policies, and records for transactions initiated
          or completed by AXYS Creative or via the Website. Additionally, the

          18. Sharing and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Provision
        </h3>
        <p>
          AXYS Creative retains the right to showcase design work on digital
          platforms, such as social media and its website, unless an alternative
          agreement is reached. The Client has the option to establish a
          Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with AXYS Creative. If such an NDA is
          executed, it will override AXYS Creative's right to publicly share or
          discuss the Client's work.

        <h3 class="policies-title">19. Entire Agreement and Enforceability</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use, along with any additional policies displayed on
          the Website, represent the complete agreement and understanding
          between the Client and AXYS Creative. The failure of AXYS Creative to
          exercise any right or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use does
          not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Should any part of
          these Terms be deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that specific
          provision will be severed from these Terms of Use, but this will not
          affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.
          Furthermore, nothing within these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or
          on the Website should be interpreted as establishing a joint venture,
          partnership, employment, or agency relationship between the Client and
          AXYS Creative.
