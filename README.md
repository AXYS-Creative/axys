// Forms

The 'name' attribute on the <form> field is what's displayed in the Netlify dashboard.

The 'action' attribute is only needed when redirecting the user to a new page. In our case, we are able to remove it and have javascript handle to logic for form submissions. See ./form.js for the code.
